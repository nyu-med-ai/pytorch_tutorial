# 90-Minute PyTorch Blitz

A repository for running a basic denoising CNN in PyTorch with examples.

## Milestones / Goals

1) Introduce attendees to PyTorch.
2) Provide code for interacting with Matlab data.
3) Demonstrate coding and training of a basic, 4-layer CNN.

## Installation

First, you'll need to install Anaconda from here:

https://github.com/nyu-med-ai/pytorch_tutorial

Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Then, you'll need to create a new environment, activate it and install the
packages:

```sh
conda create --name pytorch_tutorial
conda activate pytorch_tutorial
bash anaconda_setup.bash
```

You should get a bunch of installation messages. After this you should be able
to run the code.

## Basic Example

### Data

Data is automatically loaded from a ```pytorch_tutorial_data/``` folder in the
root directory of the repository.

Data for this code is provided internally to NYU researchers. For external
researchers, executing the examples in this repository can be done with any set
of multicoil, Cartesian k-space data. One such set of data can be downloaded at
```https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/``` (with some conversions for the dataloader
in this repository). The included dataloader expects the raw data to be stored
as contiguous, multicoil complex Matlab arrays. Behavior can be inferred by
inspecting ```data/kneedata.py``` and the corresponding transform modules.

### Running the example

To run the main example, after installing Anaconda with the required packages
you should just have to run

```python
python denoise_main.py
```

After that the training will begin. outputs from the training are logged using
tensorboard into a new `logs/` directory in the folder, along with the best
model. If the training is interrupted, rerunning `denoise_main.py` will search
the `logs/` folder for the previous best model and continue training from
there.
