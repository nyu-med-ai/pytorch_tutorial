# 90-Minute PyTorch Blitz

A repository for running a basic denoising CNN in PyTorch with examples.

## Milestones / Goals

1) Introduce attendees to PyTorch.
2) Provide code for interacting with Matlab data.
3) Demonstrate coding and training of a basic, 4-layer CNN.

## Installation

First, you'll need to install Anaconda from here:

https://github.com/nyu-med-ai/pytorch_tutorial

Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Then, you'll need to create a new environment, activate it and install the
packages:

~~~~sh
conda create --name pytorch_tutorial
conda activate pytorch_tutorial
bash anaconda_setup.bash
~~~~sh
